# Spoolman for Multi tools

## Prerequisites

### A working Spoolman instance

Spoolman is just a webapp, you don't need to have it runing on your printer, and in this case you wil need to host it somewhere else.
You can find instruction on how to install standalone [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) on its [wiki](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/wiki/Filament-Usage-History).
You can choose 2 differtn patsh:

- [docker](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/wiki/Installation#docker-install): the easiets in my opinion
- or you can go nuts with pyton's delirium versions and dependencies and choose a [standalone](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/wiki/Installation#standalone-install) path
